# Status Updates Playbook

Guidelines for writing team updates that are easy to scan, honest about challenges, and generous with recognition.

## Philosophy

- **Outcomes first** - Lead with results and impact, not activity
- **Scannable** - Emoji-anchored sections, bullet points, short paragraphs
- **Honest** - Acknowledge challenges directly, then reframe with context
- **Warm** - Credit individuals by name, use inclusive language
- **Evidence-backed** - Link to production, docs, metrics to show not tell

## Quick Reference

## When to Use

- Team or stakeholder progress updates
- Manager/exec communications
- Slack channel announcements
- Sprint summaries or retrospectives
- Launch communications

## Core Patterns

### Structure

1. **Friendly hook** (optional): Seasonal reference or greeting
2. **Section headers**: Emoji prefix + bold title
3. **Bullet points**: Outcome-first, with inline evidence links
4. **Named recognition**: Specific individuals at section end
5. **Forward momentum**: End with what's next

### Framing Challenges

Never bury bad news. Acknowledge it, then provide context:

> "Great progress and some less-than-ideal timeline changes. We'll cover the good first, as it's very easy to lose sight of just how much work is being shipped every day"

**Pattern:** [Bad news] + [acknowledge feeling] + "There is [context] though:" + [reframing bullets]

### Evidence and Links

Weave links naturally into claims:

> "shipped to production, to the X page ([our fastest growing page](link))"

Use footnotes for caveats that would clutter the main flow.

## Format Templates

### Progress Update (Default)

```markdown
[Optional seasonal hook]

**:emoji: Section Title**

[1-2 sentence summary]

- [Outcome with inline link]
- [Component work with `backticks`]
- [Connection to future benefit]

Big thanks to @person1, @person2, @person3

**:emoji: Next Section**
...
```

### Quick Patterns

- **3-2-1:** 3 wins, 2 risks/issues, 1 ask (exec-friendly)
- **RAG:** Status color + summary + mitigation + target date
- **Past/Present/Future:** Shipped, in flight, coming next

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Open with a hook before diving in
- Use emoji for visual hierarchy (one per section)
- Credit individuals by name
- Link to evidence
- Use `backticks` for technical terms
- End with momentum

**Don't:**
- Bury or avoid bad news
- Use emoji as decoration
- Give vague thanks ("thanks everyone")
- Write dense paragraphs
- Over-explain technical concepts
