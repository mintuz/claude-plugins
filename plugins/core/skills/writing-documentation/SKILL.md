# Developer Writing Playbook

Write technical articles that developers can skim first and trust enough to finish. Keep pages fast, headings meaningful, and tone practical.

## Purpose & Audience

- Write for developers: tutorials, how-tos, reviews, docs, and opinion pieces.
- Lead with clarity and payoff; assume readers skim before committing.
- Keep pages performant with concise, direct copy.

## Titles & H1

- Title case; 5–8 words (~50–60 chars) with one natural keyword.
- Make the benefit obvious (e.g., “X for Faster Y”).
- Exactly one `<h1>` per page containing the title.

## Headings & Structure

- Use `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections; avoid deeper levels.
- Add a heading roughly every 200–250 words; include the keyword once in a relevant `<h2>` and `<h3>`.
- Preserve logical flow; headings should summarize the payoff of the section.

## Paragraphs & Formatting

- Short paragraphs (3–5 sentences/lines). Lead with the point, then details.
- Use lists to break up dense info; number steps when order matters.
- Apply bold sparingly for the primary keyword and key phrases; italics for light emphasis only.

## Sentence-Level Clarity

- Use active voice and straightforward vocabulary; break complex ideas into shorter sentences.
- Aim for ~65-character reading width; avoid walls of text.

## Lists & Consistency

- Use bullets for unordered ideas; numbered lists for steps/rankings.
- Keep item phrasing consistent; end items with periods (or none—just be consistent).
- Avoid long inline enumerations; move them into lists.

## Voice, Tone, and Perspective

- Friendly, practical, confident. Write in first/second person (“I”, “you”).
- State what the reader will achieve, then show how.

## Intros & Outros

- Intro: 1–2 short paragraphs stating the goal and payoff; for tutorials, “In this guide you’ll learn to…”.
- Outro: 1–3 short paragraphs (optionally a brief bullet list) with key takeaways and a clear call-to-action.

## General Priorities

- Make content scannable: clear headings, short paragraphs, purposeful emphasis.
- Keep performance in mind: concise pages and sensible formatting choices.
- Maintain brand consistency: correct product names/capitalization and logo usage when applicable.
- Ensure every piece starts with what’s in it for the reader and ends with what to do next.
