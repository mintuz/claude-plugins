# Writing Formatting Guidelines

Structural formatting rules for developer-facing content.

## Titles & H1

- Title case; 5–8 words (~50–60 chars) with one natural keyword.
- Make the benefit obvious (e.g., "X for Faster Y").
- Exactly one `<h1>` per page containing the title.

## Headings & Structure

- Use `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for subsections; avoid deeper levels.
- Add a heading roughly every 200–250 words; include the keyword once in a relevant `<h2>` and `<h3>`.
- Preserve logical flow; headings should summarize the payoff of the section.

## Paragraphs & Formatting

- Short paragraphs (3–5 sentences/lines). Lead with the point, then details.
- Use lists to break up dense info; number steps when order matters.
- Apply bold sparingly for the primary keyword and key phrases; italics for light emphasis only.

## Lists & Consistency

- Use bullets for unordered ideas; numbered lists for steps/rankings.
- Keep item phrasing consistent; end items with periods (or none—just be consistent).
- Avoid long inline enumerations; move them into lists.

## Intros & Outros

- Intro: 1–2 short paragraphs stating the goal and payoff; for tutorials, "In this guide you'll learn to…".
- Outro: 1–3 short paragraphs (optionally a brief bullet list) with key takeaways and a clear call-to-action.
